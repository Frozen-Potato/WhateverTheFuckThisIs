## Flowcharts for Protocols

### 1. TCP â€” Connection-Oriented & Reliable

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Client: SYN] --> B[Server: SYN-ACK]
  B --> C[Client: ACK]
  C --> D[Connection Established]
  D --> E[Data Transfer with ACKs]
  E --> F[Connection Termination (FIN/ACK)]
  F --> G[TIME_WAIT State]
```

Shows the **3-way handshake**, reliable data transfer with ACKs, and proper termination.  

---

### 2. UDP â€” Connectionless & Fast

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Client: Send Datagram] --> B[Network]
  B --> C[Server: Receive Datagram]
  C --> D[Process or Drop]
```

No handshake, no guarantees â†’ simple but fast.  

---

### 3. SCTP â€” Advanced Transport Protocol

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Association Setup] --> B[Multi-Stream Established]
  B --> C[Data Sent Across Multiple Streams]
  C --> D[Handles Message Boundaries]
  C --> E[Supports Multiple IP Paths (Multihoming)]
  D --> F[Association Termination]
```

Keeps **message boundaries**, avoids head-of-line blocking, and supports multiple IP addresses.  

---

## âœ… Summary
- **TCP** = Reliable phone call (handshake, ACKs, ordered).  
- **UDP** = Quick postcard (fast, but can be lost).  
- **SCTP** = Phone system with multiple lines (advanced features: streams + multihoming).
