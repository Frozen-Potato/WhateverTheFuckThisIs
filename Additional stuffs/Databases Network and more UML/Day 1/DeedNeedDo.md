# Day 1 â€“ Improve the foundation of the [library](../../../Main%20Example/Library/) again

Having erected a respectable edifice of object-oriented timber in the first sprint, we now turn our attention to laying proper stone foundations beneath it. This second endeavour concerns itself not merely with polish, but with permanence, reinforcing our once-modest library into a sturdier institution of databases, protocols, and disciplined concurrency. In short, we tidy up the architecture before the whole contraption collapses under the weight of modernity.
